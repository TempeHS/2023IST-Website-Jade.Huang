  <h2><p><strong>Diet 😋</strong></p></h2>
  <p>Capybaras are herbivores (caring for their fellow animals) so their diet consists of grasses, barks, tubers, and sugar cane. 🌿<p>
  <p>Capybaras are excellent swimmers, so they can also eat aquatic plants. 🌊</p>

  <p><strong><em>Lots of adorable footage of capybaras eating whole watermelons have been filmed, but they should not eat too much sugar (that includes all fruit!) as they cannot process sugar and it can lead to bloating 🤒.</em></strong></p>
