  <P><strong>All about capybaras!</strong></P>
  <P>Capybaras are very cute and furry. They are brown with a large body and a perpetually calm aura that makes it a friend of all animals.</P>
  <P>Certain capybaras have been seen to hang out (real) and ride crocodiles (it was actually another capybara but shhh).</P>
