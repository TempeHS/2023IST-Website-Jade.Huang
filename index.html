  <p>Capybaras are very cute and furry. They are brown with a large body and a perpetually calm aura that makes it a friend of all animals.</p>

  <h2><p><strong>Diet 😋</strong></p></h2>
  <p>Capybaras are vegetarians (caring for their fellow animals) so their diet consists of grasses, barks, tubers, and sugar cane.
  <p>Capybaras can swim, so they can eat aquatic plants.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Lots of adorable footage of capybaras eating whole watermelons have been filmed, but they should not eat too much sugar (that includes all fruit!) as they cannot process sugar and it can lead to bloating 🤒.</em></strong></p>

  <h2><strong>⭐ Fame ⭐</strong></h2>
  <p>Capybaras are known for their videos featuring the song "Ok i pull up" (real name <em>After Party</em>), where they chill and do their own thing, bringing happiness to everyone's lives.</p>
