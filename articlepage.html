<p>The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent[2] and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.</p>

	<p>The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.
		It
		is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the
		lesser
		capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
		distantly
		related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and
		lives
		near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but
		usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease
		from
		its thick fatty skin. It is not considered a threatened species.</p>

	<h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat)
		+
		ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".</p>

	<p>The scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος
		(choiros
		"pig, hog").</p>

	<p>Classification and phylogeny</p>
	<p>The capybara and the lesser capybara both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The
		living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.
		Since
		2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the
		rock
		cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.</p>

	<p>Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for
		the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus, but more recently have adopted the
		classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state
		of
		flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is
		largely
		due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an
		individual.
		In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar
		shape
		is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense. Among
		fossil species, the name "capybara" can refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that are more closely
		related to
		the modern Hydrochoerus than to the "cardiomyine" rodents like Cardiomys. The fossil genera Cardiatherium,
		Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all capybaras under that concept.</p>

	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Taxidermy specimen of a capybara</p>
	<p>The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body
		that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its
		skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over
		hair. </p>
